          <strong>Simple & Effective Skincare Routine for Oily Skin</strong> 
          <br> Managing oily skin is all about balance—stripping it leads to more oil, while the right products help control shine and prevent breakouts without over-drying. <br>

          In the morning, start with a gentle foaming cleanser like CeraVe Foaming Cleanser or La Roche-Posay Effaclar Gel. Use a toner if needed (like The Ordinary Glycolic Acid or Paula’s Choice Pore-Reducing Toner), then apply a niacinamide serum to regulate oil and minimize pores. Follow with a lightweight, oil-free moisturizer—Neutrogena Hydro Boost or CeraVe PM are great choices. Finish with a non-greasy SPF like EltaMD UV Clear or La Roche-Posay Anthelios.
          <br>
          At night, repeat your cleanse and apply a BHA exfoliant like Paula’s Choice 2% BHA Liquid a few times a week to clear pores. For acne-prone skin, consider a treatment like Differin Gel. Seal it in with your oil-free moisturizer.
          Once or twice a week, use a clay mask like Aztec Secret for deep cleansing. And for mid-day shine, blotting sheets are your best friend.
          Keep it simple and consistent, and your skin will thank you—with fewer breakouts, less shine, and a healthy, balanced glow.

          <strong>Nourishing Skincare Routine for Dry Skin</strong> <br>
          Dry skin needs moisture and barrier support, not harsh stripping products. A few hydrating layers can go a long way in keeping your skin soft, smooth, and glowing.

          In the morning, use a gentle, creamy cleanser like CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser or La Roche-Posay Toleriane. Follow with a hydrating toner or essence—Hada Labo Gokujyun Lotion is a great pick. Add a hyaluronic acid serum for deep hydration, then seal it all in with a rich moisturizer like First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Cream. Finish with a moisturizing sunscreen such as EltaMD UV Daily.
          
          At night, repeat your cleanse, toner, and serum. Add a face oil like squalane for extra nourishment before using a thicker night cream or balm like Weleda Skin Food or CeraVe Healing Ointment.
          
          Once or twice a week, use a hydrating mask or gentle exfoliant to smooth dry patches. With consistency, your skin will stay hydrated, healthy, and happy.

          <strong>Balanced Skincare Routine for Combination Skin</strong> <br>
          Combination skin means you're oily in some areas (usually the T-zone) and dry or normal in others. The key is balance—hydrating without clogging and controlling oil without over-drying.

In the morning, start with a gentle gel cleanser like La Roche-Posay Toleriane Purifying Cleanser to remove excess oil without stripping dry areas. Follow with a lightweight hydrating toner or essence—Klairs Supple Preparation Toner works well. Apply a serum with niacinamide (The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc) to help balance oil and refine pores. Use a gel-cream moisturizer like Neutrogena Hydro Boost, and finish with a non-greasy sunscreen like EltaMD UV Clear.

At night, cleanse again and repeat your toner and serum. You can spot-treat oilier areas with a BHA like Paula’s Choice 2% BHA Liquid a few times a week. Use a slightly richer moisturizer or layer a hydrating serum underneath your gel cream for drier areas.

Once or twice a week, use a clay mask on your T-zone and a hydrating mask on your cheeks to treat both zones separately. Keeping things lightweight, layered, and consistent is the best way to keep your skin clear, smooth, and balanced.
