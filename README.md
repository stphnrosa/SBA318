**SBA Module 318**
Express Server Application using Node and Express, while creating RESTful API using Express. 
Objectives included using and creating express middleware. In this SBA, a template 
engine is used to render views with express, and interact with a self made API through HTML Forms.

**Description**
This project aimed to build an express server application. It used express routes to handle HTTP Methods such as GET & POST. Middleware was used to manage requests and responses while simultaneously implementing an API for interaction. EJS templates were utilized in this application.

 or you could use nodemon server.js if installed. You would be able to see all live changes on your browser by typing http://localhost:3000
